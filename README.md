# Business Project

A school project using Windows Form UI with MySQL database and Entity Framework via .NET.    
The application is about managing employees in hierarchy. Basic CRUD operations about salaries, departments etc., it has basic User Authentication.   

The code and the logic may be far from good, but it was fun introduction to .NET and Entity Framework. :)
